# Investigate tmdbmovie dataset

The datset was gotten from kaggle and downloaded manually for easy use.
Among the question the Analysis answered was who was:

  who the most popular director for most popular movie was
  
  most popular genres likely to be popular
  
  the movie that generated the most revenue
  
  the director who generated the most revenue
  
All this done after cleaning visually and programmatically the tmdb movie daraset and cleaning the errors found to make the data easiy for analysis.

It's simple and easy to use as guideline...

Thanks for stopping by.
